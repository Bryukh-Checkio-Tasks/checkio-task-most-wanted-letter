<p>
    You are given a text, which contains different english letters and punctuation symbols.
    You should find the most frequent letter in the text. The letter must be in lower case.<br>
    Case does not matter and "A" == "a". Don't count punctuation symbols and whitespaces, only letters.
    If you have two or more letters with the same frequency, then return the first in the alphabet.
    (Ex: we have "b" and "f" as the most frequent, then return "b")

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A text for analysis. A string (Unicode).

    <strong>Output: </strong> The most frequent letter. A string.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    For most of decryption tasks need to know the frequency of occurrence of various letters in the texts.
    Also this information may be interesting for language experts.
    As example we can easily crack simple addition or substitution cipher if we know the frequency of appearing the
    letters.
